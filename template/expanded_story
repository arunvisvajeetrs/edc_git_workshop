There was a family of wolves that lived deep in the woods. They were
preparing for their annual reunion, which would be attended by
Grandma Wolf. As they were setting up decorations, they realized
they had forgotten to prepare the most crucial part of the
gathering - food.

After a quick brainstorming session, the wolves decided to
hunt for their meal. They tracked down a plump hen and
successfully caught it. They celebrated their triumph
but were interrupted by the arrival of Grandma Wolf.

With excitement, they ran to greet her. Grandma was really impressed!
With a happy look they said,
"Lets go to the kitchen and let's eat, Grandma!"

Grandma Wolf was delighted to see her family after a long
time. As they walked home, she noticed that something was
missing. "Where is the food, my dear ones?" she inquired.

The wolves looked at each other with guilt and explained
that they had gone hunting because they had forgotten the
food. Grandma Wolf inspected the hen and pointed out that
it belonged to a nearby farmer, who would miss it. She
reminded them to be considerate of others and their belongings.

Feeling remorseful, the family of wolves apologized to
Grandma Wolf and decided to make things right. They
went to the farmer and apologized for taking the hen
without permission. They also visited other animals in
the woods and made amends for any other harm they had caused.

After making things right, the wolves learned a valuable
lesson about respect and being mindful of their actions.
They picked a basket of berries and used them to prepare
a delicious meal for their reunion.

As they sat around the dinner table, the family shared
stories, laughed, and enjoyed the delicious food. They
agreed that it was the best reunion they had ever had
because they had learned the importance of respecting others.
